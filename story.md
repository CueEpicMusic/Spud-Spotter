## Description

A web app that allows users to collaboratively create maps which list multiple "points". For example: "Best Places to Eat Around Town" or "Locations of Movie Scenes".

A map can contain many points. Each point can have: a title, description, and image.

## Authenticated users:

A web app where authenticated users can create and modify maps (add, edit, remove points).

Authenticated users can't modify other users' maps.

Users can favourite a map. E.g.: Given that I am logged in, when I click favourite on a post, then it is added to my favourites and the save icon will change to indicate success.

Users have profiles, indicating their favourite maps and maps they've contributed to.

## Non-Authenticated users:

Both authenticated and non-authenticated users can see a list of the available maps.
